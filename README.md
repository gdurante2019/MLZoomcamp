### About ML Zoomcamp
This is a practical course where you'll learn to build and deploy machine learning systems. We focus on the engineering side from training models to getting them to work in production.

**You'll learn:**

* Core ML algorithms and when to use them
* Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
* Preparing data, feature engineering
* Model evaluation and selection
* Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
* Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
* Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow

**Technical setup:** For machine learning modules, you only need a laptop with an internet connection. For deep learning sections, we'll use cloud resources for more intensive computations.
